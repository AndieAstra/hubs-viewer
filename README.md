##### VR Integration
[WebGPU Stereo Display Example](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgpu_display_stereo)

##### AR Integration
[AR.js in future builds, compatibility with older devices.](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/)

---

## Bug List:
- Need to reinstate console log
- Pano Notes: When user clicks to generate a note they keep going back to the center of the sphere. Take a look at the complete script to see why it is not generating a note where the user places it.

## Challenges & Notes

* **GLB/GLTF Model Size**: Large models may result in long load times.
* **Physics**: Balancing performance with realistic collisions.
* **Local-only**: No cross-device synchronization (no cloud or backups).
* **Three.js & Angular Integration**: Use `ngAfterViewInit` for initializing Three.js (since the canvas needs to be ready).
* **File Storage**: Models can be stored as binary blobs in IndexedDB or prompt re-upload if data is too large.
